    I couldn't do the Part IV (Testing with Dr. Java & images). 
    My computer died, so I've been doing this assignment solely on 
    lab computers, which evidently don't have the In library, meaning
    that I couldn't run TOY.java or subsequent programs. Hanssen, in office 
    hours, told me that that was okay, and that I should just email my
    program to Jack who could do that part for me (which is what I did). 
    Apologies for the inconvenience!

    This is an unusually short readme. I liked this assignment; despite
        feeling completely and hopelessly lost as we learned TOY in class,
        as soon as I started working with it I found it very simple. The
    assignment itself was manageable and even sort of fun. Yaaaaay TOY :)
